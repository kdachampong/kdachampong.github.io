## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

It's my first time using Tailwindcss. I gave me a new perspective on styling and a further understanding of some CSS concepts like Flexbox.

### Continued development

I certainly would continue to explore Tailwindcss more and possible adopt it for my projects.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - I used it as reference to understand the CSS principles behind Tailwindcss
